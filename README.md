# Features

- Server Maxplayer Filling with Bots
   - Server Load Testing with synthetically-increased playercount
   - Offensive server filling, preventing real players from connecting
   - Custom Join Times (Recommended to keep interval_min and interval_max times different to randomise the traffic)
- Sending Custom Packets to Server
   - Filling console with crashing/error-ing/annoying log messages
   - Create thousands of playerfiles in server /world/playerdata 
   - UUID packet spammer ('login_spam', 'double_login' Modules) *Will produce Extremely large amounts of console-spam with UUID-resolver*) - Potentially dangerous as it with will increase disk-usage as all this spam will have to be logged. ALSO - minecraft servers unfortunately (by default) don't announce whom this traffic is coming from, so even trying to diagnose is difficult.
   - Potential use with Proxies / Proxy List is possible, (yet) here is not implemented.
